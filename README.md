# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
In this project I analysed data provided in an Excel spread sheet "Kickstarter". The data provided included information about different crowdfunding campaigns from different countries. I utilized various data analytics and visualization tools, such as filtering data, formulas, pivot tables and pivot charts to answer questions posed by the client. The functions used in the prpject are SUM, YEAR, VLOOKUP, and COUNTIFS. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyse provided data set, uncover trends and help start a crowdfunding campaign based on the findings. 
## Analysis and Challenges
Data in the set was filtered and used for  creation of pivot charts and tables attached below. In order to analyse the data based on outcomes, COUNTIFS function was used. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It is unclear what information is included in Staff Pick and Spotlight columns and how it could be used to analyse the data. If this information can be provided, the data can be analyzed further. 

## Results

###What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  May and June had the highest number of successful campaigns while November and December had the lowest number of successful campaigns. Additionally, May, June and July had the highest number of campaigns started. Based on this data, it is better for the client to consider starting her campaign in May or June.But based on the data provided, the number of competing campaigns is higher too. 
  
  
###What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
   Based on this analysis, the campaigns that had established goal between $1000 and $4999 were the most successful followed closely by goals in range $35000 to $44999. Additionally, 100% of campaigns that had goals set lower than $1000 failed. Based on the analysis, the client should set the goal in range $1000-$4999. 
   
###What are some limitations of this dataset?
   One of the limitations of this database is that amounts for the campaigns are provided in different currencies which could cause inconsistencies in analysis due to converison rates. This fact might explain the number of outliers and some large gaps between the groups wheen they were anayzed based on goals/outcomes.For instance, British pound is worth more than US dollar and Australian dollar is less. 
    
###What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 All amounts could be converted into USD which would yiled  more consitent data for further analysis. Then we would rerun an analysis of successful, failed and cancelled groups based on all data now being in USD and see how it differs from the previos results.
